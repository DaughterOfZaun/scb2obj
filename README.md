scb2obj
=======

Description
-----------

This is a simple .scb to .obj converter.

While looking for a way to use League of Legends' resources, I came accross DragonGeo2's description of the SCB file format, and I decided to write a simple converter from this format to Wavefront OBJ, a well-known and easy-to-load format.

Usage
-----

scb2obj FILE.scb

It will create a FILE.scb.obj file in the Wavefront OBJ format.

There are no options.

License
-------

scb2obj is placed under the WTFPL license. Have fun!
